Action Plan 12/5/
-Hashim clones UiBranch, works on UiBranch
-When Hashim completes a view, he does a pull request to the UiBranch
-Hashim uses whatever frontend tools/frameworks/libraries that he wants (as long as it's bootstrap)
-Hanif provides feedback and direction on the UI under advisement from UX Chief
-Plain html files will go under HTMLViews
-TODO: Add bootstrap 4 to the UserInterface branch of the project (for Hashim to clone)
-Hashim.xyx
-We'll use cards on everything via bootstrap 4 (no theme necessary)
